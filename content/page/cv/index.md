This article describes my personal goals for this site.
<!--more-->

## Blog
The blog will cover various topics that are of interest to me. Topics include but are not limited to:
* Software and Hardware Development
* Aerospace
* Technology
* Cooking
* Gardening
* Outdoors

## Projects
I intend to write about my interest in growing my software development skills through personal open source projects. My current two projects are apricot, a file explorer built in zig, and OsOS, a 16-bit operating system targeting the IBM 5150.

## CV
An up to date CV will be maintained on the site.
